## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Practiced what i have been learning about react. It was fun making this project. And i'm proud of how it went. I know i have so much more to learn, but i'm happy to see that i can practice things i learned without any outside help.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I want to learn more about react. I feel like so far i'm following really well with what i already learned.
